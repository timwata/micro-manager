# Micro Manager

A macOS menu-bar app that lights each running [Herdr](https://herdr.dev) agent
on its own key of a Work Louder
**[Creator Micro 2](https://worklouder.cc/creator-micro-2)**, and jumps to that agent
when you press the key.

It is the bridge itself — no Node, no daemon, nothing to install on the Herdr
side. It reads Herdr's socket directly and drives the pad over raw HID.

The Herdr does not have to be on your Mac: list a few SSH hosts in the config
and switch the pad between this Mac and any of them from the menu bar — see
[A Herdr on another machine](#a-herdr-on-another-machine).

## Install

Download, unzip, drag `MicroManager.app` to Applications, and launch it. macOS
will ask for **Input Monitoring** — grant it, then toggle the manager off and on
from the menu-bar panel so it reconnects with the permission.

Or build it yourself:

```bash
./scripts/bundle.sh --install     # build, sign, install to /Applications, launch
```

You will also need a Creator Micro 2 and a running Herdr server with agents in
it. Quit Work Louder's Input app and the Codex desktop app while you use this —
all three drive the same lighting and will overwrite each other.

## What the pad does

**The icon** shows state at a glance: dimmed when off, a coloured dot when
running — green all idle, amber something working, red something needs you —
and a badge when the pad is missing or permission is denied.

**The top six keys** are one agent each, in the order Herdr's own panel lists
them. Colours are red (blocked, breathing), amber (working), blue (done —
finished but not yet looked at) and green (idle — finished and seen). Herdr
distinguishes done from idle by whether you have focused the pane yet, so blue
means something is waiting to be read and green means quiet. The **underglow**
carries the worst state across all agents, so "does anything need me?" is
readable from across the room.

Pressing an agent key focuses that agent in Herdr **and brings the terminal
forward** — Herdr selects the pane but leaves the window where it was, so an
agent key pressed from a browser used to move a cursor you could not see. Set
`WL_TERMINAL_BUNDLE_ID` if your panes do not live in Ghostty.

**Row 3** is actions:

| key | what it does |
|---|---|
| stack | floats the GitButler stack for the focused agent |
| tabs | cycles the tabs of the focused Herdr window |
| land | lands the focused agent's branches, bottom first |
| macro | types a configured string into the agent's prompt |

**Row 4** is the wide key — it taps right command, which starts and stops
Superwhisper — and one more
macro key.

**The dial** tunes reasoning effort. **The joystick** switches model: it puts
the model list on screen, north and south move, east confirms, west cancels.

### The stack key

It floats `but status` in the middle of the screen; press again to put it away.
The window never takes focus — you are reading it *from* the terminal you were
already typing in, and a read-only view that steals the keyboard would cost two
keystrokes to undo. Click the output to select text, click anywhere else to
dismiss.

`but` is found by search, not by `PATH`: an app launched by launchd inherits
`/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin`, so the binary your terminal finds instantly is
invisible here. Homebrew and Cargo locations are checked directly, then your
login shell is asked. Set `WL_BUT_PATH` to skip all of it.

## The panel

Click the menu-bar icon. It draws the pad in its real shape with every key
showing its live colour, then one row per agent. Click a key or a row to jump to
that agent. It also carries the on/off switch, the choice of which Herdr to
mirror ([this Mac or another machine](#a-herdr-on-another-machine)), an "Open
at login" toggle, a
warning when another app is fighting for the device, and the **Inspector**
button.

**Off** clears the lights and stops driving, but deliberately leaves the device
keymap alone: rebinding is a flash write, and the keys light instantly on the
way back in if the bindings are still there.

## The Inspector

The debug UI ships inside the app — the **Inspector** button in the panel opens
it. It logs every message in both directions (`TX`, `RX`, `NOTIFY`, `DEVICE`),
decodes the device's abbreviated notifications, and drives the lighting by hand:
per-key colours and effects, the two zones, a key walk, and a raw JSON-RPC
console with presets.

It lives at `MicroManager.app/Contents/Library/Inspector.app`, signed by the
same identity as its host, so it is one download and one trust decision. During
development there is no surrounding bundle, so run it directly:

```bash
swift run WLInspector
```

Run that **from your terminal**, not from Finder: macOS attributes Input
Monitoring to the responsible process, so a terminal that already has the grant
passes it on.

## No pad to hand

Tick **Emulate the pad** in the panel and a window opens with a virtual Creator
Micro 2 in it. The bridge drives its lights exactly as it drives the hardware,
and clicking a key — or the dial, or the joystick — sends the same
`v.oai.hid` report back, so the whole loop works with nothing plugged in.

```bash
WL_EMULATE=1 swift run WLMicroManager    # start emulated, no clicking required
```

It is a stand-in for the firmware rather than a picture of one, and it
reproduces the firmware's more awkward habits deliberately, because those are
the ones that cost time on real hardware:

- it answers `{"ok":1}` to any lighting payload, right or wrong;
- it boots on the **stock F-key keymap**, so the app has to bind the keys
  before anything can light — and a key that is not bound to `KV_OAI_AG*`
  accepts its colour in silence and stays dark;
- an unbound key reports nothing when pressed, because on the pad it would be
  sending a keystroke instead.

The window also shows the RPC traffic, and **Reset** puts a factory pad back.

The emulator lives inside the app, so it stands in for the device for Micro
Manager only — the Inspector is a separate process and still needs hardware.

## Configuration

Everything works without a config file. To rebind the macro keys or change what
the dial and joystick offer, drop a `config.json` into
`~/.config/micromanager/`:

```json
{
  "keys": {
    "9":     "Open PRs for all active GitButler branches",
    "12":    "Run but pull",
    "10+11": "Summarise what you are working on"
  },
  "claude": { "models": ["fable", "opus"], "efforts": ["low", "high"] },
  "codex":  { "models": ["gpt-5.6-sol", "gpt-5.6-codex"] }
}
```

A bound string is injected into the focused agent's prompt, unsubmitted — you
still read it and press enter. `"10+11"` addresses the wide key as one; `"10"`
and `"11"` address its halves. Keys the file does not mention keep their
defaults, and an empty string unbinds a key outright. Binding the wide key to
text replaces its right-command tap.

`codex.models` is your copy of what Codex's own `/model` menu offers, in its
order — the joystick steers that menu rather than owning it, so there is nothing
to read it from.

**Edit Config…** in the panel opens the file, creating an empty one first if
there is none.

A few environment variables override the defaults:

| variable | what it overrides |
|---|---|
| `WL_TERMINAL_BUNDLE_ID` | the terminal to raise (default Ghostty) |
| `WL_BUT_PATH` | the GitButler binary, skipping the search |
| `HERDR_SOCKET_PATH` | the Herdr socket — wins over the **Herdr** menu, which is then disabled |
| `WL_SIGN_IDENTITY` | the signing identity `bundle.sh` uses |
| `WL_EMULATE` | `1` drives the virtual pad for that run, whatever the panel says |

## A Herdr on another machine

The pad can mirror a Herdr running on another machine — a workstation, a GPU
box, a cloud VM — reached over SSH. Nothing is installed there: the app opens
an SSH tunnel to the remote Herdr socket and talks to it exactly as it talks to
the local one. One server at a time; the pad never mixes agents from two.

### Setting it up

1. **Make sure `ssh <host>` logs in without a prompt.** The app runs the system
   `ssh` in batch mode, with no terminal to type a password or accept a host
   key into. Use a key or an agent (the macOS agent, 1Password, or whatever
   `~/.ssh/config` points at), and run `ssh <host>` once in a terminal to
   trust the host key.
2. **List the host under `remotes`** in `~/.config/micromanager/config.json`
   (**Edit Config…** in the panel opens it):

   ```json
   {
     "remotes": [
       { "name": "workbox", "host": "workbox" },
       { "name": "gpu", "host": "me@gpu-box", "socket": "/run/user/1000/herdr.sock" }
     ]
   }
   ```

   | field | |
   |---|---|
   | `name` | the label in the menu; must be unique |
   | `host` | anything `ssh` accepts as a destination — aliases, `ProxyJump` and identities from `~/.ssh/config` all apply |
   | `socket` | optional; the Herdr socket on that machine, default `~/.config/herdr/herdr.sock` (`~` is the remote home) |

3. **Pick it from the Herdr menu** at the top of the panel. The line under the
   menu says *Connecting…*, then *Connected via SSH*, and the keys light with
   that machine's agents. **This Mac** goes back. The choice survives a
   relaunch.

Config edits show up the next time the panel opens — no relaunch needed.

### What changes on a remote

- **Stack** and **Land** are dark and do nothing: they run `but` on this Mac,
  and the agent's working directory is on the other one.
- Everything else works — agent lights and focus, tab cycling, macros, the
  dial, the joystick and the voice key. Agent keys raise the local terminal you
  run the ssh session in.
- The menu-bar icon turns grey while the link is down, so an empty pad never
  passes for "no agents", and its tooltip says which host it mirrors.
- The tunnel is a dedicated `ssh` process owned by the app (connection sharing
  via `ControlMaster` is turned off for it). Quitting stops it, and even a
  crash ends it on its own, so no stray ssh is left behind.

### When it does not connect

The error appears in red under the menu. Network trouble and a Herdr that is
not running yet are retried by themselves (3 s, backing off to 30 s). A
rejected key, an unknown host key or a server that forbids forwarding is **not**
retried — repeated failed logins can get your IP banned — so fix it and press
**Retry**.

| message | what to do |
|---|---|
| Run `ssh <host>` once in a terminal to trust the host key. | do that, then **Retry** |
| SSH key auth failed (no password prompts from a menu-bar app). | set up key or agent auth for that host |
| No Herdr is listening at … on `<host>`. Is Herdr running there? | start Herdr there, or fix `socket` |
| `<host>` does not allow forwarding Unix sockets … | enable `AllowStreamLocalForwarding` in that server's `sshd_config` |
| Timed out logging in to `<host>`. | check the network, VPN or `ProxyJump` |

If `HERDR_SOCKET_PATH` is set, it wins: the Herdr menu is disabled and says
so. Herdr sets that variable in every pane it runs, so an app started from
inside a Herdr pane (`swift run` during development) gets the disabled menu —
start it with `env -u HERDR_SOCKET_PATH` to use the picker.

## Why it must be bundled and signed

`swift run` works for development because it inherits your terminal's Input
Monitoring grant. A background app needs its own, and macOS keys that grant to
the **code signature** — so an ad-hoc signature, whose hash changes on every
build, forces you to re-grant after every rebuild. `bundle.sh` prefers a real
Apple Development or Developer ID identity from your keychain, which gives a
stable designated requirement and makes the grant stick. It also sets
`LSUIElement` so there is no Dock icon, and gives `SMAppService` a bundle it
will actually register as a login item.

Every push to main republishes the **`latest`** release, so the download link
above always points at the current build; tagging `v*` cuts a permanent
versioned release alongside it. Both go through
[the release workflow](.github/workflows/release.yml).

That workflow signs with a Developer ID and notarizes when the repository has
the secrets for it — the file lists them — and falls back to an ad-hoc
signature when it does not, rather than failing. An ad-hoc build works, but
macOS stops it until you right-click → Open, and because the grant is keyed to
the signature and an ad-hoc one changes every build, Input Monitoring has to be
granted again after each update. The release notes say which kind you are
downloading.

## Only one bridge at a time

Work Louder's Input app and the Codex desktop app drive this same pad. Running
two at once means they overwrite each other. The panel detects this — the device
is opened shared, so we receive other clients' replies, and a response id we
never issued is a reliable tell. The **Inspector** counts too, once it changes
the lighting: it is a separate process with its own connection to the pad.

The manager also asks macOS which other processes hold the pad open, each time
the panel opens and whenever such a reply comes in. The warning names the app
that most likely sent it ("Also driving this pad: Micro Manager Inspector —
colours may fight."), and it clears by itself the next time you open the panel after that
app has quit. **Recheck** next to the warning clears it on the spot and
repaints the pad with the manager's colours. Switching the manager off clears
the warning too.

Holding the pad open is not driving it, so that alone never raises the
warning. Work Louder's Input app keeps the pad open while it runs in the
background, tells the pad which app is in front on every app switch, and
reconnects and asks for the pad's status every time you unlock the Mac; the
manager ignores those messages, since they leave the lighting alone. Only
another app's lighting changes and keymap writes count. Some apps (input remappers, macro or streaming tools) open
every HID device without ever touching the lighting. The manager remembers
the apps that were holding the pad quietly, and blames a reply on an app that
arrived since. If one of the quiet apps starts sending, the warning names all
of them and stays until they have quit or you press **Recheck**.

Over Bluetooth the pad is a single device that also carries the keyboard, so
apps that only listen for keys (chat apps, for one) hold it open too. They
are quiet holders like any other. See
[design/pad-contention.md](design/pad-contention.md) for the details.

## Development

```bash
swift build            # both apps and the shared library
swift test             # live tests skip themselves without hardware
swift run WLInspector  # the debug UI
./scripts/bundle.sh    # assemble and sign build/MicroManager.app (--install to install it)
```
