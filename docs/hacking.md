# Hacking the Work Louder Creator Micro 2

A step-by-step guide to driving the pad from your own code: setting individual
key colours, reading key presses back, and using the dial and joystick as
inputs. No Work Louder software involved — this talks to the firmware directly.

Everything here is verified on a
**[Creator Micro 2](https://worklouder.cc/creator-micro-2), firmware v0.6.0-rc.10**,
over USB and Bluetooth, on macOS. Examples are Node with
[`node-hid`](https://github.com/node-hid/node-hid); the same protocol is
implemented in Swift/IOKit in `Sources/WLKit/`, which is what the app itself
uses.

> **The one thing to know before you start.** The firmware answers `{"ok":1}` to
> almost any payload, including malformed ones. A wrong shape looks exactly like
> a right one. The only ground truth is the LEDs. Budget for that.

## 1. What you need

- A Work Louder pad on vendor id `0x303A`. This guide is written for the
  Creator Micro 2 (`0x8297` / `0x8298`); the transport is shared with the other
  boards this firmware family covers.
- Node 18+ and `npm install node-hid`.
- **macOS: Input Monitoring** for whatever process runs your code — System
  Settings → Privacy & Security → Input Monitoring. Add your terminal while you
  are developing. Without it, opening the interface fails with `privilege
  violation`.
- **Linux:** a udev rule granting access to the `303a:` HID device.
- Quit Work Louder's Input app and the Codex desktop app first. Both drive this
  same pad and will fight you for it.

---

## 2. Find the interface

The pad presents several HID collections. You want the **vendor** one: usage
page `0xFF00`, usage `1`. That is where the JSON-RPC channel lives.

```js
const HID = require("node-hid");
const info = HID.devices().find(
  (d) => d.vendorId === 0x303a && d.usagePage === 0xff00 && d.usage === 1,
);
console.log(info);
```

Two things that will bite you if you skip them:

**Open non-exclusively.** hidapi seizes the device by default. This pad puts its
vendor collection on the same underlying device as a *keyboard* collection, and
macOS refuses to let anything seize a keyboard. A seizing open fails with
`0xE00002C1`, which reads exactly like a missing permission and is not.

```js
const hid = new HID.HID(info.path, { nonExclusive: true });
```

**Match on the usage pair, not the primary usage.** Over Bluetooth the pad is a
*single* device whose primary usage is keyboard (`usagePage 1, usage 6`), with
the vendor collection listed alongside in its usage pairs. Over USB each
interface is its own device, so picking the first vendor-id match lands you on
the keyboard and every write is silently dropped. `node-hid`'s `devices()` list
is already flattened per usage pair, so the filter above is correct; if you use
IOKit directly, check `DeviceUsagePairs` — see `WLDevice.hasVendorCollection` in
`Sources/WLKit/WLDevice.swift`.

---

## 3. The wire format

JSON-RPC 2.0, carried over 64-byte raw HID reports:

```
byte 0      report id, always 0x06
byte 1      channel: 1 = firmware debug log, 2 = JSON-RPC
byte 2      payload length in THIS report, max 61
bytes 3..   UTF-8 fragment of the JSON message
```

A message longer than 61 bytes is split across as many reports as it needs.
There is no sequence number and no end marker — you reassemble the incoming
stream by **scanning for balanced top-level braces**.

Requests look like `{"method": "...", "params": ..., "id": 42}`. Two rules:

- **Call ids must be under 1000.** The firmware rejects anything larger.
- **Responses and notifications use different envelopes.** A response carries
  `method`/`params` and an `id`. A device-pushed notification carries
  **`m`/`p`** and *no* id. Match only on `method` and every key press vanishes
  silently — this is the single most common way to conclude the keys are inert
  when they are not.

Colours go on the wire as a packed `0xRRGGBB` integer. `brightness`, `speed` and
`magic` are floats in `0..1`.

---

## 4. A minimal transport

Save this as `wl.js`. It is about 90 lines and is all you need for everything
below. (The production version, with reconnect handling and a fake-device mode,
is `Sources/WLKit/WLDevice.swift`, in Swift.)

```js
"use strict";
// wl.js - minimal Work Louder raw-HID JSON-RPC transport.
const HID = require("node-hid");

const VID = 0x303a, USAGE_PAGE = 0xff00, USAGE = 1;
const REPORT_ID = 0x06, CH_DEBUG = 1, CH_RPC = 2, CHUNK = 61;

function open() {
  const info = HID.devices().find(
    (d) => d.vendorId === VID && d.usagePage === USAGE_PAGE && d.usage === USAGE,
  );
  if (!info) throw new Error("no Work Louder vendor interface found");

  // nonExclusive is required: the vendor collection shares a device with a
  // keyboard collection, and macOS refuses to let anyone seize a keyboard.
  const hid = new HID.HID(info.path, { nonExclusive: true });

  const pending = new Map();
  let accum = "";
  const bus = { info, hid, onNotify: null, onLog: null, call, close };

  hid.on("data", (buf) => {
    // node-hid may or may not include the report id as byte 0.
    for (const off of [1, 0]) {
      const channel = buf[off], len = buf[off + 1];
      if (channel !== CH_DEBUG && channel !== CH_RPC) continue;
      if (len === undefined || len > CHUNK) continue;
      const text = buf.slice(off + 2, off + 2 + len).toString("utf8");
      if (channel === CH_DEBUG) { if (bus.onLog) bus.onLog(text); return; }
      accum += text;
      for (const obj of drain()) dispatch(obj);
      return;
    }
  });

  // Pull complete top-level JSON objects out of the accumulator. Brace counting
  // has to skip over strings: keymap.json arrives as a JSON string full of them.
  function drain() {
    const out = [];
    let depth = 0, start = -1, inStr = false, esc = false;
    for (let i = 0; i < accum.length; i++) {
      const c = accum[i];
      if (inStr) {
        if (esc) esc = false;
        else if (c === "\\") esc = true;
        else if (c === '"') inStr = false;
        continue;
      }
      if (c === '"') inStr = true;
      else if (c === "{") { if (depth++ === 0) start = i; }
      else if (c === "}" && depth > 0 && --depth === 0) {
        try { out.push(JSON.parse(accum.slice(start, i + 1))); } catch {}
        accum = accum.slice(i + 1);
        i = -1; start = -1;
      }
    }
    if (accum.length > 8192) accum = "";
    return out;
  }

  function dispatch(obj) {
    // Notifications use the abbreviated envelope {m, p}; responses use `method`.
    const method = obj.m !== undefined ? obj.m : obj.method;
    if (method !== undefined && obj.id === undefined) {
      if (bus.onNotify) bus.onNotify(method, obj.m !== undefined ? obj.p : obj.params);
      return;
    }
    const waiting = pending.get(obj.id);
    if (!waiting) return;          // a reply to an id we never sent: another client
    pending.delete(obj.id);
    clearTimeout(waiting.timer);
    if (obj.error) waiting.reject(new Error(obj.error.message || "rpc error"));
    else waiting.resolve(obj.result);
  }

  function call(method, params = null) {
    const id = Math.floor(Math.random() * 999);   // firmware rejects ids >= 1000
    const payload = Buffer.from(JSON.stringify({ method, params, id }), "utf8");
    for (let off = 0; off < payload.length; off += CHUNK) {
      const n = Math.min(CHUNK, payload.length - off);
      const report = Buffer.alloc(64);
      report[0] = REPORT_ID;
      report[1] = CH_RPC;
      report[2] = n;
      payload.copy(report, 3, off, off + n);
      hid.write(Array.from(report));
    }
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
      const timer = setTimeout(() => {
        pending.delete(id);
        reject(new Error(`timeout waiting for ${method}`));
      }, 8000);
      pending.set(id, { resolve, reject, timer });
    });
  }

  function close() { try { hid.close(); } catch {} }

  return bus;
}

module.exports = { open };
```

---

## 5. First contact

```js
const { open } = require("./wl.js");

(async () => {
  const dev = open();
  console.log("device:", dev.info.product);
  console.log("firmware:", await dev.call("sys.version"));
  console.log("status:", await dev.call("device.status"));
  console.log("files:", await dev.call("fs.list", { checksum: false, rec: true }));
  dev.close();
})();
```

`sys.version` returns `{"version": "v0.6.0-rc.10"}`. `device.status` carries
`battery`, `is_charging` and `layer_index` among others. If all three answer,
your transport is correct and everything else is payload shape.

A method the firmware does not register answers **`Method not found`** — which
is genuinely useful, because it distinguishes "this variant doesn't have it"
from "I sent the wrong shape". Use it to probe the firmware you actually have.

---

## 6. Zone lighting: the easy win

Before per-key, get the two whole-device *zones* working. There are two:
`keys` (the plate under the keycaps) and `ambient` (the underglow).

```js
const GREEN = 0x00c853;
const zone = (color, effect = 1) => ({ e: effect, b: 1, s: 0.5, m: 1, c: color });

await dev.call("v.oai.rgbcfg", {
  keys:    zone(0, 0),        // effect 0 = off
  ambient: zone(GREEN),       // effect 1 = solid
});
```

Note the **abbreviated field names** — `e` effect, `b` brightness, `s` speed,
`m` magic, `c` colour — and that **`e` is a number**, not a string. This is the
part that silently no-ops if you get it wrong.

There is also an older `lights.preview` taking `backlight` and `underglow` with
*full* field names and *string* effects. It is what Work Louder's own Input app
uses. It works, but it cannot address individual keys, so it is a dead end for
anything interesting:

```js
await dev.call("lights.preview", {
  underglow: { effect: "solid", brightness: 1, speed: 0.5, magic: 1, color: GREEN },
});
```

---

## 7. The keymap prerequisite

**A key can only be lit individually if it is bound to a `KV_OAI_AG*` keycode on
the active layer.** This is the gate that makes per-key colour look impossible
until you find it. Nothing reports the mismatch: per-key calls still answer
`{"ok":1}` for a key that cannot light. Parking the codes on a spare layer does
nothing — it must be the *active* layer.

The trade-off is real and worth understanding before you do it: **an AG-bound
key stops sending its keystroke.** It does not go silent, though — it reports
itself over HID instead (see [§9](#9-key-events)), so it becomes a status light
*and* an input. Bind only the keys you intend to own.

### The keymap file

The device stores its configuration as `keymap.json`, read and written over the
same RPC channel. It is **double-encoded**: `fs.read` returns `{"data": "<a JSON
string>"}` where the inner string is the real config.

```js
const raw = await dev.call("fs.read", { file: "keymap.json" });
const config = JSON.parse(raw.data);
```

The shape you care about, from a stock Creator Micro 2:

```jsonc
{
  "activeProfileId": 0,
  "profiles": [{
    "layers": [{
      "layout": {
        // Rows are [2, 4, 4, 3]. Key index is row-major from 0.
        "keymap": [
          ["KC_F13", "KC_F14"],
          ["KC_F15", "KC_F16", "KC_F17", "KC_F18"],
          ["KC_F19", "KC_F20", "KC_F21", "KC_F22"],
          ["KC_F23", "KC_NONE", "KC_F24"]
        ],
        "encoders": [["KC_VOLU", "KC_VOLD", "KC_MPLY"]],   // [CW, CCW, press]
        "joystick": {
          "type": "RADIAL",
          "sectors": [
            { "k": "KI_X",  "a1": 0.1875, "a2": 0.3125 },
            { "k": "KC_P1", "a1": 0.3125, "a2": 0.4375 }
            // ...8 sectors in all
          ]
        }
      }
    }]
  }]
}
```

`layer_index` from `device.status` is 1-based against the `layers` list, so the
active layer is `layers[0]`.

### Back it up first

```js
require("fs").writeFileSync("keymap-backup.json", JSON.stringify(raw));
```

Keep it. Restoring is just writing that same `data` string back.

### Bind some keys

Read, modify, write, then **read back and verify** — the write is accepted
whether or not it took.

```js
// Bind key 3 (row 1, column 1) so it can be lit.
const layer = config.profiles[config.activeProfileId ?? 0].layers[0];
layer.layout.keymap[1][1] = "KV_OAI_AG03";

await dev.call("fs.write", { file: "keymap.json", data: JSON.stringify(config) });

const after = JSON.parse((await dev.call("fs.read", { file: "keymap.json" })).data);
console.log(after.profiles[0].layers[0].layout.keymap);
```

Key *N* takes keycode `KV_OAI_AG` + zero-padded *N* — key 3 is `KV_OAI_AG03`.
The mapping is positional, so write per key rather than per row unless you mean
to take a whole row's keycodes with it.

> This is a **flash write**. Do it once at startup when something has actually
> changed, not in a loop.

### Geometry

The matrix is `[2, 4, 4, 3]` and the key index runs row-major from 0. One
surprise: **the top row is wired right to left**, so index 0 is the top-**right**
key.

```
 ┌─────────────┬─────────────┐
 │      1      │      0      │   row 0   <- reversed: 0 is on the RIGHT
 ├──────┬──────┼──────┬──────┤
 │   2  │   3  │   4  │   5  │   row 1
 ├──────┼──────┼──────┼──────┤
 │   6  │   7  │   8  │   9  │   row 2
 ├──────┴──────┼──────┴──────┤
 │    10 + 11  │     12      │   row 3
 └─────────────┴─────────────┘
```

Rows 1–3 run left to right in index order. Matrix positions 10 and 11 sit under
one wide keycap — the stock map leaves 11 as `KC_NONE`; bind and light both if
you want the whole cap to glow evenly.

---

## 8. Per-key colour

This is the payoff. The method is `v.oai.thstatus`, and each key is a "thread".

**Params are a bare ARRAY**, not an object — one entry per key you want to
change:

```js
// Key 3, solid red, full brightness.
await dev.call("v.oai.thstatus", [
  { id: 3, c: 0xff0000, b: 1, e: 1, s: 0.5 },
]);
```

That is the whole trick. Three keys, three colours:

```js
await dev.call("v.oai.thstatus", [
  { id: 0, c: 0xff2d2d, b: 1, e: 4, s: 0.5 },   // red, breathing
  { id: 1, c: 0xffaa00, b: 1, e: 1, s: 0.5 },   // amber, solid
  { id: 2, c: 0x00c853, b: 1, e: 1, s: 0.5 },   // green, solid
]);
```

Fields, all optional except `id` — **omitted fields leave that aspect
unchanged on the device**:

| field | meaning |
|---|---|
| `id`  | key index, 0-based, row-major (required) |
| `c`   | packed `0xRRGGBB` integer |
| `b`   | brightness, `0..1` |
| `e`   | effect **as a number** (see table below) |
| `s`   | speed, `0..1` |
| `sk`  | `1`/`0` — mirror this thread onto the keys zone |
| `sa`  | `1`/`0` — mirror this thread onto the ambient zone |

Effects are the firmware's own set:

| value | effect | value | effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | off     | 4 | breathing |
| 1 | solid   | 5 | gradient |
| 2 | snake   | 6 | shallow breath |
| 3 | rainbow |   | |

Each key can carry its **own** effect, not just its own colour — one key
breathing while its neighbours sit solid works fine.

**Thread state paints over zone state.** A key with a thread colour ignores the
`keys` zone; the zone only shows through where no thread colour is set. That is
also why turning the pad off takes two calls — see [§11](#11-turning-everything-off).

### Prove it with a walk

The test that settles whether an index really maps to the physical key you
think it does: light one key at a time and watch it move.

```js
for (let id = 0; id <= 12; id++) {
  const threads = Array.from({ length: 13 }, (_, i) => ({
    id: i, c: i === id ? 0x00ff00 : 0, b: i === id ? 1 : 0, e: i === id ? 1 : 0,
  }));
  await dev.call("v.oai.thstatus", threads);
  await new Promise((r) => setTimeout(r, 400));
}
```

If a key stays dark while the rest walk past it, that key is not AG-bound on the
active layer. Go back to [§7](#7-the-keymap-prerequisite).

---

## 9. Key events

An AG-bound key sends no keystroke, but it reports itself as a **notification**:

```json
{"m": "v.oai.hid", "p": {"k": "AG01", "act": 1}}
```

- `k` — the key name, `AG00`..`AG19`. The number is the key index, the same one
  you use as a thread id.
- `act` — `1` on press, `0` on release.
- `ag` — an agent field belonging to the Codex firmware's own agent-key
  feature. `OAI.agIndex` in `Sources/WLKit/OAIProtocol.swift` ignores it, and
  nothing here depends on it.

Remember the envelope is `m`/`p`, not `method`/`params`.

```js
const dev = open();
dev.onNotify = (method, params) => {
  if (method !== "v.oai.hid") return;
  const match = /^AG(\d+)$/.exec(params.k || "");
  if (!match) return;
  const index = Number(match[1]);
  console.log(`key ${index} ${params.act === 1 ? "pressed" : "released"}`);
};
// keep the process alive
setInterval(() => {}, 1 << 30);
```

So a single key is both a lamp and a button: light it with thread `id`, and it
answers on the same index. That is what makes "the key you look at is the key
you press" work.

---

## 10. The dial and the joystick

Neither has an LED, but both can be turned into the same clean `v.oai.hid`
events as the keys — which is usually what you want, because you get discrete,
debounced signals instead of a raw stream to threshold yourself.

### The dial

`layout.encoders` is a list of `[clockwise, counter-clockwise, press]`. Bind the
two rotation slots and leave the press alone unless you want it:

```js
layer.layout.encoders[0][0] = "KV_OAI_AG13";   // CW
layer.layout.encoders[0][1] = "KV_OAI_AG14";   // CCW
```

Each detent now arrives as `AG13` / `AG14` through the same notification
handler. There is nothing at index 13/14 to light — these ids are inputs only.

### The joystick

The joystick is radial: eight sectors, each with an angle range `a1..a2`
expressed as a **fraction of a full turn**, where **0 is east and the angle
increases counter-clockwise**.

| sector centre | direction | stock keycode |
|---|---|---|
| 0.000 | east  | `KC_P6` |
| 0.125 | NE    | `KC_P7` |
| 0.250 | north | `KI_X`  |
| 0.375 | NW    | `KC_P1` |
| 0.500 | west  | `KC_P2` |
| 0.625 | SW    | `KC_P3` |
| 0.750 | south | `KC_P4` |
| 0.875 | SE    | `KC_P5` |

Bind whichever you want. Match on the sector's centre rather than its bounds —
the east sector wraps through zero (`a1: 0.9375, a2: 0.0625`), so a naive
midpoint gives you 0.5 instead of 0.0:

```js
const centre = (a1, a2) => ((a2 >= a1 ? (a1 + a2) / 2 : (a1 + a2 + 1) / 2) % 1);
const cardinals = { 0.25: "KV_OAI_AG15",   // north
                    0.50: "KV_OAI_AG16",   // west
                    0.75: "KV_OAI_AG17",   // south
                    0.00: "KV_OAI_AG18" }; // east

for (const sector of layer.layout.joystick.sectors) {
  const c = centre(sector.a1, sector.a2);
  const hit = Object.keys(cardinals).find((k) => Math.abs(Number(k) - c) < 0.01);
  if (hit) sector.k = cardinals[hit];
}
```

Deflections now arrive as `AG15`–`AG18`.

### Raw joystick position

The device also pushes a continuous radial notification:

```json
{"m": "v.oai.rad", "p": {"a": 0.25, "d": 0.8}}
```

`a` is the angle on the same 0..1 scale, `d` the distance from centre, 0..1.
Use this if you want analogue position rather than four discrete directions —
you handle your own deadzone and repeat-rate. The sector-binding route above is
the easier one and is what Micro Manager uses; the Inspector decodes and logs
`v.oai.rad` if you want to watch it.

---

## 11. Turning everything off

Clearing the zones is **not** enough — thread state overrides them, so the keys
stay lit. Clear both. The firmware's keycode table runs to `AG19`, so clear the
whole id space rather than just the 13 visible keys:

```js
const dark = { e: 0, b: 0, s: 0.5, m: 1, c: 0 };

await dev.call(
  "v.oai.thstatus",
  Array.from({ length: 20 }, (_, id) => ({ id, b: 0, e: 0, sk: 0, sa: 0 })),
);
await dev.call("v.oai.rgbcfg", { keys: dark, ambient: dark });
```

## 12. Reference

### Methods

| method | direction | purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `sys.version` | call | firmware version |
| `device.status` | call | battery, charging, active layer index |
| `fs.list` | call | list device files — `{checksum: false, rec: true}` |
| `fs.read` | call | read a file — `{file: "keymap.json"}` |
| `fs.write` | call | write a file — `{file, data}`, flash write |
| `v.oai.thstatus` | call | **per-key lighting**, params are a bare array |
| `v.oai.rgbcfg` | call | zone lighting — `{keys, ambient}` |
| `lights.preview` | call | legacy two-surface lighting — `{backlight, underglow}` |
| `host.focused_app` | call | tell the device which app has focus |
| `v.oai.hid` | **notify** | key press/release — `{k, act, ag}` |
| `v.oai.rad` | **notify** | joystick position — `{a, d}` |

The two notification names are *not* callable; calling them returns `Method not
found`, which is correct and not a sign of trouble.

### AG keycodes

| keycode | what it addresses |
|---|---|
| `KV_OAI_AG00`–`KV_OAI_AG12` | the 13 keys, in matrix order |
| `KV_OAI_AG13` / `KV_OAI_AG14` | dial clockwise / counter-clockwise |
| `KV_OAI_AG15`–`KV_OAI_AG18` | joystick north / west / south / east |

### Field-name cheatsheet

`v.oai.*` uses abbreviated names and numeric effects. `lights.preview` uses full
names and string effects. Mixing them is the classic silent failure.

| | `v.oai.rgbcfg` / `thstatus` | `lights.preview` |
|---|---|---|
| colour | `c` (int) | `color` (int) |
| brightness | `b` | `brightness` |
| effect | `e` (**number**) | `effect` (**string**) |
| speed | `s` | `speed` |
| magic | `m` | `magic` |
| sections | `keys`, `ambient` | `backlight`, `underglow` |

## 13. Traps

Collected from the time each one cost.

**`{"ok":1}` means nothing.** The firmware accepts any payload, including
malformed ones, and returns success. Verify against the LEDs.

**Matching on `method` drops every key event.** Notifications use `m`/`p`.

**A key that is not AG-bound on the *active* layer cannot be lit,** and nothing
tells you. Threads for it still return `{"ok":1}`.

**Thread colour overrides zone colour.** Zones only show through where no thread
colour is set, and "all off" needs both cleared.

**Call ids must be under 1000.**

**Effects are integers in `v.oai.*`.** Passing `"solid"` is accepted and does
nothing.

**Open non-exclusively,** or macOS refuses with `0xE00002C1` — which looks
exactly like a permission problem and is not.

**If you use IOKit directly, hold the `IOHIDManager`** for the lifetime of the
connection. Let it go out of scope and the devices it opened are torn down with
it; every later `IOHIDDeviceSetReport` fails with `kIOReturnNotOpen`
(`0xE00002CD`) even though the open reported success.

**You are not the only client.** Opening shared means you also receive *other*
applications' responses. A response carrying an id you never issued is a
reliable tell that something else is driving the pad — Work Louder's Input app
and the Codex desktop app both do.

That tell is passive: a client that has the pad open but is quiet goes unseen.
To ask actively, read the IORegistry. Every process that opens an interface
gets an `IOHIDLibUserClient` under it, named by its `IOUserClientCreator`:

```bash
ioreg -r -n "Creator Micro 2" -l -w0 | grep -E 'PrimaryUsagePage|IOUserClientCreator'
```

Over USB, look only under the vendor interface (`PrimaryUsagePage` = 65280):
every `"pid <n>, <name>"` there can drive the lighting. The keyboard
interface has listeners of its own (chat apps, for one) that never touch the
vendor protocol. Over Bluetooth the pad is one device carrying the keyboard
too, so its list mixes both. `WLDevice.otherClients()` does this walk in Swift
(`Sources/WLKit/WLDevice+Clients.swift`). `IOUserClientCreator` is not
documented API, and the kernel may cut a long process name short.

Holding is not driving: Work Louder's Input app keeps its client on the vendor
interface for as long as it runs, window or not, so a listed process is only
someone who *could* send. The bridge warns on replies only, and uses the list
to say who may have sent them and when they have gone.

Not every foreign reply is about the lighting, either. Input sends
`host.focused_app` on every frontmost-app change, window or not, and the
firmware answers it with a bare `"result": null` (checked on 2026-10-10; the
lighting calls answer `{"ok":1}`, `sys.version` an object). Input also
drops and reopens every device on each screen unlock (Electron's
`unlock-screen`), and a second after reconnecting asks for `device.status`
(`sys.version` if that fails), both answered with an object. Only the reply
is seen, never the call, so the bridge goes by its shape: a foreign reply
counts only when it is an error or a dictionary with an `ok` key (the
lighting calls and `fs.write`). Request ids are no help in telling senders
apart: Input's look random, while `WLDevice` counts 1…998.

**Variant gating is real.** These vendor methods are registered per hardware
variant. If `v.oai.thstatus` returns `Method not found` rather than `{"ok":1}`,
this firmware genuinely does not have it. Older Creator Micro 2 firmware
(v0.4.0, v0.6.0-rc.8) registered the methods as no-op stubs — accepted
everything, lit nothing.

## Where the working code lives

Everything above is implemented in Swift, in this repository:

| | |
|---|---|
| `Sources/WLKit/WLDevice.swift` | the transport: matching, the shared open, framing and reassembly |
| `Sources/WLKit/OAIProtocol.swift` | the vendor lighting API (`v.oai.*`), the pad map and key-event decoding |
| `Sources/WLKit/KeymapManager.swift` | reading, checking and writing the keymap |
| `Sources/WLKit/BridgeController.swift` | the bridge; `lightsOffCalls` is the two-call blanking above |
| `Sources/WLKit/PadEmulator.swift` | an in-process stand-in for the firmware, awkward habits included |
| `Sources/WLInspector/` | a GUI for watching traffic and driving lights by hand |

The Node snippets in this guide are self-contained: save them as shown and
they run without anything else from this repository.

`WLInspector` is the fastest way to try a payload shape, or to find out which
methods your firmware actually registers: it has a raw JSON-RPC panel with
presets, and logs every message in both directions with the notifications
decoded.

```bash
swift run WLInspector
```

Run it from a terminal that already has Input Monitoring — macOS attributes the
grant to the responsible process, so a binary launched from Finder will be
refused.
